Zhenrui Cao received his B.Eng. degree in 2021 from Tian University, Tianjin, China. He is currently a PhD candidate with the School of Computer Science and Technology, College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin  University, Tianjin, China. His research interests include the industrial Internet of Things, deterministic networks, time-sensitive networking, and industrial control protocol. He has published several papers in top journals and conferences, such as IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC), IEEE Communications Magazine (ComMag), 2025 IEEE 28th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (IEEE CSCWD 2025), and 19th International Conference on Wireless Artificial Intelligent Computing Systems and Applications (WASA 2025). He is a reviewer for several journals and conferences, including IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN), JSAC, ComMag, and IEEE CSCWD 2024. He is a student member of IEEE and ACM.
<!-- He has won many scholarships at Tianjin University, including the Chinese Government-sponsored Study Abroad Scholarship, the First-class Academic Scholarship, the Lenovo Scholarship, and the Outstanding Youth Scholarship. -->
